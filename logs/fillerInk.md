### Day 0: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3 out of 6 problems in the SDS Coder Hunt Challenge

**Thoughts:** Competetive programming was something I always wanted to improve and add to my skills. 

### Day 1: January 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fiddled with lists and the zip( ) function in python. 

**Thoughts:** zip( ) function inside a loop can create nested lists which are kinda annoying to work with.

### Day 2: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Rewatched 3blue1brown's video on neural networks

### Day 3: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More of lists and nested lists

**Thoughts:** Wrote a function to convert nested lists to flat ones. Donno if it'll work in every combination of nested lists.

### Day 4: January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on android app, and also spent some time practicing competetive programming.

**Thoughts:** Realised that you can input a string in python freely, even if it contains special characters, but in Java's Scanner object, the special characters are not being read.

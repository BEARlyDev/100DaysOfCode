# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, Tuesday
##### Init

**Today's Progress**: Revamped the 100DaysOfCode telegram bot

**Thoughts**:
    * I love Python
    * The code of the bot is pretty messy. I don't like seeing bad code. It makes me YUCK ! and then I spend time fixing the code. This is my OCD
    * Looking forward to making this bot work and use it in group !

### Day 2: January 2, Wednesday
##### Init

**Today's Progress**: Converted bot to python3. Trying to deploy it in heroku

**Thoughts**:
    * PyICU dependency is not building on heroku

### Day 3: January 3, Thursday
##### Init

**Today's Progress**: Can't deploy on heroku. That dependency is a BIG pain. Tried many ways to solve it. Nothing worked

**Thoughts**:
    * It's heroku's fault. The module can't be built in their server cause the LD_PATH is not correct
    * I don't like Heroku much anymore
    * [I've also decided to do **#100DaysOfHealth** challenge](https://twitter.com/subins2000/status/1080897625417703424).

### Day 4: January 4, Friday
##### Init

**Today's Progress**: I made the bot into a docker image and it works well locally ! Pushing it now to heroku to see if that works too

**Thoughts**:
    * [Docker building & uploading is time consuming](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pablo-escobar-waiting)
    * Got some free time ðŸ˜‚

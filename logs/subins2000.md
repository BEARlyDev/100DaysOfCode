# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, Monday
##### Init

**Today's Progress**: Revamped the 100DaysOfCode telegram bot

**Thoughts**:
	* I love Python
	* The code of the bot is pretty messy. I don't like seeing bad code. It makes me YUCK ! and then I spend time fixing the code. This is my OCD
	* Looking forward to making this bot work and use it in group !
